<font color="blue" face="Curlz MT"><h1><q>hlw prithibi What is Lorem Ipsum?</q></h1></br> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</br>
blocquote>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,</br> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
It has survived not only five centuries,</br>
but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established 
</br>fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using </font>

<pre> A command-line argument is an 
        information that directly follows the program's
           name on the command line when it is executed.
              To access the command-line arguments inside a 
                Java program is quite easy.
                    They are stored as strings in the String array passed to main( )

Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for</br> 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). Where does it come from?
</br> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,
a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,</blockquote>

<cite>discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of </br>"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</cite>

<p>Paragraph Writing: Take a wild guess as to what will you say to describe a paragraph? From whatever you may know so far, many students describe paragraphs as what consists the story, or a set of sentences that are grouped together to form a paragraph or a set of sentences that cover half a page of your story, and so on.

Although these ideas may look true in many instances, they donâ€™t really define what the idea behind a paragraph is. This is one of those subtle things in English writing that never really gets explained on priority making it one of those commonly used things that are barely understood. Which is why this read is going to be great.</p>
