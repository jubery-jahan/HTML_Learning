A visit to any place can be an amazing adventure as wherever you go it becomes a part of your life. The one place I never get tired of visiting is
 the beach even though I have visited it so many times. One can always wonder how visiting the same place always gives different experience as each
 time we visit a place it is a completely different story .By the very act of coming back you wipe out whatever came before.
 The beach is just an amazing place to be, just listening to the sound of the waves,
 feeling the cool breeze across my face and my feet emerged into the sand makes me feel so relaxed, 
peaceful and completely free as though, I am in a magical place so calm and beautiful .And as you sit there and keep dreaming the beautiful sunset appears,
 “which gives your heart a change of mood of the day that you had rude”. Oh, how beautiful it is. Sunsets are a proof that no matter whatever happens in your day,
 each day can end beautifully .Being in this beautiful moment is the best escape anyone can have from reality for a little while .Looking at the  beautiful sea 
rushing wild and free but stops with a gentles touch on your feet en kindles my soul. Even though at the end as we walk away the sands my brush off,
 the salt my wash away, the tans may fade away. But those beautiful memories will remain .At the end of the day life is an art of drawing which can never be erased .
So, as long as you make beautiful memories and have fun a visit to any place is an amazing journey that can never be forgotten.

Visit to a beach is always an exciting trip. Usually, people visit beaches with their families and friends to break away from the daily life and relax.
The cool breeze, the pleasant weather, the waves of water, the wet sand, the view of the horizon etc. are the things everyone loves about the beaches.
People from all ages, young and old, visit the beach in great numbers especially during the hot summer season. I had an opportunity to visit a beach
 last summer with my parents.
Beach Description:
ADVERTISEMENTS:

A warm and muggy day was the perfect weather combination to go to the beach. The water of the sea was crystal clear and deep blue in colour. 
There was not a bit of sea weed in our sight. As one listens to the sound of the waves roaring and the breezy wind of the sea brushing by, 
you can spot boats sailing in the deep seas
. I looked at the people around who were soaking themselves in the sun and were in line to get in the water.

Diving Into the Water:
As the white sand burned under my feet, I took a deep breath of fresh air. I put the sunscreen on my body and ran towards the water.
 There were small kids nearby who were building sandcastles and throwing sand at each other. I saved myself from the sand balls being hurled 
in the air and started running closer to the waters where the waves were crashing.
